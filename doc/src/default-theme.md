# Default Theme

Ornate's default theme generates multiple HTML pages for the site, one per page. It uses [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)'s Flexbox-based CSS layout for responsive design across different classes of devices. All assets are included in the generated site by default.

## Configuration

This is the theme's default configuration:

```yaml src=../../core/src/main/resources/ornate-reference.conf#--doc-theme
```

## Third-Party Content

Sites that are generated by the default theme contain [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and its dependencies ([JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [what-input](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input)), all of which are available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/v6.2.2/LICENSE).

When using the [Emoji extension](markdown.md#emoji), the generated sites can contain images from the [EmojiOne project](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione) which [require attribution when used in commercial projects](http://emojione.com/licensing/).

## Search

The default theme can generate a JavaScript-based search function for the site using [Elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) (available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/blob/v0.9.5/LICENSE)). The search index includes page titles, content and keywords. See above for configuration options.

## Minification

Ornate can minify generated HTML files, JavaScript assets and CSS using the following libraries:
- [CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso) (running on Nashorn) for CSS
- [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) for JavaScript
- [HtmlCompressor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/htmlcompressor/) for HTML

Minification is turned off by default for better performance when building the site. It can be enabled with the following settings under `theme.default.global`:

```yaml src=../../core/src/main/resources/ornate-reference.conf#--doc-minify
```
