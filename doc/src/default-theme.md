# Default Theme

Ornate's default theme generates multiple HTML pages for the site, one per page. It uses [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)'s Flexbox-based CSS layout for responsive design across different classes of devices. All assets are included in the generated site by default.

## Configuration

This is the theme's default configuration:

```yaml src=../../core/src/main/resources/ornate-reference.conf#--doc-theme
```

## Third-Party Content

Sites that are generated by the default theme contain [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and its dependencies ([JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [what-input](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input)), all of which are available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/v6.2.2/LICENSE).

Sites that are generated by the default theme may contain [Foundation Icon Fonts 3](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) which is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-icons/blob/74f63dc35d569a8b796e86add76a0a535f96f734/README.markdown).

Sites that are generated by the default theme may contain fonts from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) which are available under the [SIL OFL 1.1](http://fontawesome.io/license/).

When using [Mermaid](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/) diagrams, the generated site includes Mermaid which is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/blob/0.5.8/LICENSE).

When using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for math notation, the generated site includes MathJax which is available under the [Apache License](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/blob/2.7.0/LICENSE).

When using the [Emoji extension](markdown.md#emoji), the generated sites can contain images from the [EmojiOne project](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione) which [require attribution when used in commercial projects](http://emojione.com/licensing/).

## Search

The default theme can generate a JavaScript-based search function for the site using [Elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) (available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/blob/v0.9.5/LICENSE)). The search index includes page titles, content and keywords. See above for configuration options.

## Minification

Ornate can minify generated HTML files, JavaScript assets and CSS using the following libraries:
- [CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso) (running on Nashorn) for CSS
- [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) for JavaScript
- [HtmlCompressor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/htmlcompressor/) for HTML

Minification is turned off by default for better performance when building the site. It can be enabled with the following settings under `theme.default.global`:

```yaml src=../../core/src/main/resources/ornate-reference.conf#--doc-minify
```

## Snippet Source Links

Snippets from fenced code blocks can show links to an appropriate source file by setting the `sourceLinkURI` attribute. If `sourceLinkText` is also set, it is used as the link text, otherwise the file name from the URI is used.

Example:

````markdown
```text sourceLinkURI=https://github.com/szeiger/ornate/blob/v0.2/README.md
*Ornate* is a tool for building multi-page HTML sites from Markdown sources.
```
````

This gets rendered as (link shown on mouse-over):

```text sourceLinkURI=https://github.com/szeiger/ornate/blob/v0.2/README.md
*Ornate* is a tool for building multi-page HTML sites from Markdown sources.
```

The [includeCode](markdown.md#includecode) extension can generate link targets for included snippets automatically.

## Shortcut Icons

Shortcut icons can be defined through custom `link` elements with appropriate `rel` and `href` values under `theme.default`:

```yaml src=../../core/src/main/resources/ornate-reference.conf#--doc-customlinks
```

For example, this is how you add a standard `favicon.ico` located under `global.resourceDir`:

```yaml
theme.default.links = [
  { rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }
]
```

## Index

The default theme can generate an index page from user-defined keywords. Using the [headerAttributes](markdown.md#header_attributes) extension, you can define the keywords with the `index` key. Nested keywords are separated by commas, multiple independent keywords are separated by semicolons. For example, the following header definition contributes two index entries "Bar" and "Foo, Bar" that link to the header:

```markdown
## Foo Bar {index="Bar;Foo,Bar"}
```
